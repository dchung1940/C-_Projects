## MP5

Implementing a PhotoMosaic generator, with setting up appropriate tile image to support the data structure. This is done techniques like KD tree and using nearest neighbor serach (nns) algorithm.

## MP6

Creating a random maze generator along with solutions. This uses disjoint sets data structure and dfs traversal to create maze structure and its solutions.

## MP7

Creating an interactive story list with other people to create a one full storyline regarding anything. This is done by using adjacency list and getting interested in using CYOA stories.
